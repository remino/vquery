# vQuery

jQuery is big and slow. vQuery is light and fast!

The "V" means "very fast and very good."

## Installation

```sh
npm install @remino/vquery
```

Note: Don't confuse this with the other package named `vquery`. That `vquery` is
slower than this `vquery`!

## Usage

You just need to import the package then use it!

```js
import '@remino/vquery'
```
